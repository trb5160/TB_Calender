Daily Planner

Description:  As a busy person, it would be very useful to have a schedule I can look at so I know
what I have going on each day.  To do this, I created a simple daily planner app using html, css and javascript.  The app has timeslots ranging from 9am to 5pm, the typical work day.  I can enter
stuff into the columns and then use the save button on the side to keep the data there.
